My name is Ben Chern and I grew up in Atlanta, GA with my wonderful mother, father, and sister. I am getting my degree in mechanical engineering from Columbia Univeristy, and hopefully a minor in computer science as well. 

I enjoy...
- Hiking - I've visited 20/63 National parks and am always looking to visit more
- Reading- Just finished Asimov's Foundation series (09/30/24)
- Gaming- Minecraft and Valorant mostly
- Watching Valorant Esports- #DRXWin
- Engineering (obviously)
