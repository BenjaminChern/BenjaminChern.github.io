subtitle: Welcome to my website!

My name is Ben Chern and I grew up in Atlanta, GA with my wonderful mother, father, and sister. I am getting my degree in mechanical engineering from Columbia Univeristy, and hopefully a minor in computer science as well. I am interested in robotics, both big and small and I am constantly looking for a new mechatronics project to keep me occupied. I especially enjoy merging art and engineering into something technically and aesthetically pleasing

I enjoy...
- Hiking - I've visited 20/63 National parks and am always looking to visit more
- Reading- Just finished Asimov's Foundation series (09/30/24)
- Gaming- Minecraft and Valorant mostly
- Watching Valorant Esports- #DRXWin
- Engineering (obviously)
